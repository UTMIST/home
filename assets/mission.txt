The University of Toronto, as one of the top education institutes in the world, leads the way in the field of artificial intelligence, and it has Geoffrey Hinton’s Machine Learning Group – the first of the three world-leading forces in the field of deep learning. However, undergraduate students seldom have the opportunity of getting in touch with the scholars from the Machine Learning Group, or getting exposure to leading technology in machine learning. This has created a disconnection between the undergraduate students and top scholars in machine learning. UTMIST aims to clear the mist by demystifying artificial intelligence technology, which is the most trendy technology nowadays. As a student organization focused on machine learning research, UTMIST is to establish a close connection between the undergraduate students and top academic resources at U of T.
University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team (UTMIST) is an officially certified student organization within the University of Toronto. Our mission is to let more people get to know about artificial intelligence, “Clear the mist”!
