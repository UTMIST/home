# Notes on Graph Neuro Nets

- How is this different from: just a neuro network?
  - It is modelled with graph in mind

An example of a non-graph neuro network?

- tranditional convolutional

- Slide 12, what are the red and black edges?
- RNN(q)?
- Gated?



- How is polygon RNN using graph neutal network to increase resolution?
- Deformable, what does blue and red dots mean? how is it gated?
- Slide 28 没懂



- How is pixel2mesh related to a custom ruled graph?
- graph unpooling?



- Semantic segmentation: model a picture as a graph, use 3d relationship to link them
- How is depth data obtained?
- 3D point cloud?
- How do you find the depth?
