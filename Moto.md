# Outline of the UTMIST website
The website serves as the hub of online presence for UTMIST. Its sole purpose is to enhance the learning experience of UTMIST members and promote UTMIST as a student organization. Its functions should only complement what is freely available on the web, that is, it should not serve any duplicate functions as Eventbrite, Google Forms, or Facebook. It should at most link to them when necessary.
